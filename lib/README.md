## Usage

The following tasks are available for `npm run`:

- `dev`: Run Rollup in watch mode to detect changes to files during development
- `gen-api`: Generate all project specific Typescript interfaces from the swagger.json definitions file (should be run before build:types)
- `build`: Run Rollup to build a production release distributable
- `build:types`: Run Microsoft API Extractor to rollup a types declaration (`d.ts`) file 
- `docs`: Run TypeDoc for TSDoc generated documentation in the "*docs/*" folder
- `clean`: Remove all build artifacts

## Development

**From the lib project**, issue the `npm link` (or `yarn link`) command:

```
npm link
```

Start Rollup in watch mode:

```
npm run dev
```

**From the app project**:

Link to the lib project using the `npm link @relewise/relewise-client` (or `yarn link @relewise/relewise-client`) command

Now, run your app via `npm start`.

## Development Cleanup

Once development completes, `unlink` both your library and test app projects.

**From the app project**, unlink the library using `npm unlink @relewise/relewise-client` (or `yarn unlink @relewise/relewise-client`) command:

**From the lib project**, issue the `npm unlink` (or `yarn unlink`) command:

```
npm unlink
```

## Release Publishing

Update your `package.json` to next version number, and remember to tag a release.

Once ready to submit your package to the NPM Registry, execute the following tasks via `npm` (or `yarn`):

- `npm run clean` &mdash; Assure a clean build
- `npm run gen-api` &mdash; Generate the typescript API interfaces
- `npm run build` &mdash; Build the package
- `npm run build:types` &mdash; Build API Extractor d.ts declaration

Assure the proper npm login:

```
npm login
```

Submit your package to the registry:

```
npm publish --access public
```
